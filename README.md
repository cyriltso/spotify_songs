# Spotify's songs analysis and playlists recommandation

## 1. Introduction

This is a personal project that aims to satisfy different goals :
  1. Analysis of the user's favorite music types based on his playlists
  2. Discover who are his favorite artists
  3. Able to create a playlist recommander system based on previous playlists' tracks
  
This project also aims to help to improve my personal skills on Unsupervised Learning techniques such as the Clustering and on Recommanders System
algorithms but also to make me improve on building a Data Science project from scratch (from the Data Acquisition to Storytelling).
  
## 2. Collecting the data

Data are directly collected through Spotify API (from Spotify for Developers) by using a Python module called Spotipy.

Once collected, the data will be stored inside of a DataFrame and will be saved as a CSV or SQL file.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Before making the clustering and the recommander, we will first clean the DataFrame, make some statistical analysis on it and
scale the features as preprocessing steps.

## 4. Data Analysis through Clustering

Goals 1 and 2 are going to be done through K-Means Clustering algorithm from Scikit-Learn.

## 5. Playlist Recommander

This will be done by using Collaborative Filtering algorithm.

## 6. Technical Stack

Programming language : Python 3.7, SQL
Tools : Visual Studio Code for Data Collection, Jupyter Notebook for Data Analysis, Git for code versionning
