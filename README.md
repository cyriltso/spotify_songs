# Spotify's songs analysis

## 1. Introduction

This is a personal project that aims to discover trends about the songs i'm listening on Spotify (favorite artists, kind of music, etc ...).
  
This project also aims to help to improve my personal skills on Unsupervised Learning techniques and knowledges but also to make me improve my proficiency on building a Data Science project from scratch (from the Data Acquisition to Storytelling).
  
## 2. Collecting the data

Data are directly collected through Spotify API (from Spotify for Developers) by using a Python module called Spotipy.

## 3. Technical Stack

-  Programming language : Python 3.7
-  Tools : Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Git 
-  Libraries : Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Spotipy

## 4. Contents of the repository

-  A notebook that contains the whole analysis
-  A Python script containing the algorithm to load the data from Spotify
-  A Python script to allow the user to manipulate time features
